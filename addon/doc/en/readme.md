# Markdown to HTML Converter

## Utility
This NVDA add-on allows you to convert text formatted in Markdown to HTML format using some keyboard shortcuts.

## Features
This add-on has 2 functionalities:

1. **Convert from clipboard:** Use the initial shortcut, NVDA+Alt+M, which can be modified in the Input Gestures section under the name "Markdown to HTML Converter". After the conversion is finished, the resulting text will appear on the clipboard.
2. **Convert from a .md file:** Use the shortcut NVDA+Shift+Alt+F, also modifiable in the input gestures under the previously mentioned name. Just like the clipboard conversion, the text will be on your clipboard after the process is completed. You will be notified via a window with a message, saying that the conversion has been successfully done.
   - This notification method will only apply when converting from a file; if converting from the clipboard, you will be notified through an NVDA message.

## Version History
- **Version 1.0:** Initial release of the add-on along with the features described.
